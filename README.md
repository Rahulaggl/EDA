# Constituents of a Company: A Breakdown

This project provides a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the various stakeholders within a company, both internal and external. Conducted in Python using **Google Colab**, this analysis examines the roles and impacts of management, employees, shareholders, customers, suppliers, creditors, government entities, and the local community in a corporate structure.

## Dataset

## Topics Covered

1. **Data Transformation and Pre-Processing**:  
   Cleaning and preparing data for accurate analysis.
   
2. **Merging Data Frames**:  
   Combining multiple data sources into a unified dataset.
   
3. **Statistical Analysis**:  
   Using descriptive statistics to understand attributes and relationships.
   
4. **Univariate Plots**:  
   Visualizing individual variables to assess distributions and identify outliers.
   
5. **Bivariate Analysis**:  
   Examining relationships between pairs of variables.
   
6. **Multivariate Analysis**:  
   Analyzing complex interrelationships among multiple variables.
   
7. **Time Series Analysis**:  
   Identifying trends over time for key stakeholder groups.
   
8. **K-Means Clustering**:  
   Segmenting stakeholders based on shared characteristics.
   
9. **Hierarchical Clustering**:  
   Uncovering deeper relationships among stakeholders.
   
10. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:  
    Simplifying data to highlight core insights.
    
11. **Linear Regression**:  
    Building predictive models to estimate trends in stakeholder data.

## Insights and Visualizations

Using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, I conducted visualizations and discovered patterns that provide a data-driven perspective on each stakeholderâ€™s role and influence. This project showcases advanced **EDA** techniques in **Google Colab**, making it an ideal resource for analysts interested in understanding company dynamics through detailed data exploration.
