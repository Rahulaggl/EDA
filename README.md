Constituents of a Company: A Breakdown

This project provides a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the various stakeholders within a company, both internal and external. Conducted in Python using Google Colab, this analysis examines the roles and impacts of management, employees, shareholders, customers, suppliers, creditors, government entities, and the local community in a corporate structure.

Topics Covered

1. Data Transformation and Pre-Processing: Cleaning and preparing data for accurate analysis.


2. Merging Data Frames: Combining multiple data sources into a unified dataset.


3. Statistical Analysis: Using descriptive statistics to understand attributes and relationships.


4. Univariate Plots: Visualizing individual variables to assess distributions and identify outliers.


5. Bivariate Analysis: Examining relationships between pairs of variables.


6. Multivariate Analysis: Analyzing complex interrelationships among multiple variables.


7. Time Series Analysis: Identifying trends over time for key stakeholder groups.


8. K-Means Clustering: Segmenting stakeholders based on shared characteristics.


9. Hierarchical Clustering: Uncovering deeper relationships among stakeholders.


10. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Simplifying data to highlight core insights.


11. Linear Regression: Building predictive models to estimate trends in stakeholder data.



Insights and Visualizations

Using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I conducted visualizations and discovered patterns that provide a data-driven perspective on each stakeholderâ€™s role and influence. This project showcases advanced EDA techniques in Google Colab, making it an ideal resource for analysts interested in understanding company dynamics through detailed data exploration.
